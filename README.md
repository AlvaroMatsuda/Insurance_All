# 1. Business Problem

**Company Name:** Insurance All

**Product/Service:** Offer Health Insurance

**Business Model:** An insurance policy is an arrangement by which a company undertakes to provide a guarantee of compensation for specified loss, damage, illness, or death in return for the payment of a specified premium. A premium is a sum of money that the customer needs to pay regularly to an insurance company for this guarantee.

**Current Situation:** Now they want to offer car insurance. Last year they did a research with their 380 thousand customers about their interest in getting car insurance, and the results has been storage in a database together with others customers attributes.
The product team selected 127 thousand leads to participate in a marketing campaing that will be offering the new car insurance to them. The campaing will be made through phone calls by the sales team.

**Problem:** The problem is that the sales team has capacity of making only 20 thousand calls on the period the campaing will be running.
   
# 2. Business Assumptions
For the purpose of this project, I am going to assume the following:
- The cost per phone call: BRL 100.00
- Profit per convertion: BRL 31,699.00 (which is the median of annual premium charged of those 380 thousand customers)

# 3. Solution Strategy
My solution to solve the problem was:
**Step 01. Data Description:** Use basic statistics metrics to identify data outside the scope of business.

**Step 02. Check Outliers:** Check if there are outliers on the dataset based on the assumptions cited previously.

**Step 03. Feature Engineering:** Derive new features from the original dataset that could help to predict the likelihood of interest in car insurance.

**Step 04. Exploratory Data Analysis:** Explore the data to find insights and better understand the impact of variables on model learning.

**Step 05. Data Preparation:** Prepare the data to be used on the model. (Exe: Scaling, encoding)

**Step 06. Feature Selection:** Select features that are most significant that better explain the phenomenon.

**Step 07. Machine Learning:** Train and test models and analysis of the models performance.

**Step 08. Cross Validation Scoring:** Compare the performance of the models through cross validation and selection of the best model.

**Step 09. Hyperparameter Fine Tuning:** Choose the best parameters of the model that maximize performance.

**Step 10. Translation and Interpretation of the Error:** Convert the performance of the machine learning model into business results.

**Step 11. Deploy Model to Production:** Publish the model in a cloud environment so that other people or services can use the results to improve the business decision.
