**Current Situation:** Now they want to offer car insurance. Last year they did a research with their 380 thousand customers about their interest in getting car insurance, and the results has been storage in a database together with others customers attributes.
The product team selected 127 thousand leads to participate in a marketing campaing that will be offering the new car insurance to them. The campaing will be made through phone calls by the sales team.

**Problem:** The problem is that the sales team has capacity of making only 20 thousand calls on the period the campaing will be running.
